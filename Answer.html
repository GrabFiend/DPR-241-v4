                 <h2>Q/A</h2>
                 <p class="lead">I was asked this question......"In your own words, describe a company in the technology industry most excites you. And write about why this company excites you?" </p><br>
                 <p>And I said:</p><br>
               <p>Google honestly interests me the most. They had a simple goal, they became "the" standard search engine for exactly everything. But even after, they kept excelling to become a better company. The "okay" at a lot of things, but the I've realized for the past 5 years that the things that I believe I'm the best at is Music Production and the ability to see different ways to solve a problem. I constantly use a laptop on Windows and my android smartphone on a regular basis. If I'm not on my phone, then I'm on my laptop making beats and so on. I can see myself making beats for the rest of my life. In this field that I'm studying for, what I find difficult is to remember functions within C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc.

</p><br>
                 
                 <p>What I've also learned in the past few years is that if you don't love what you’re doing, you’re not going to give 110% on effort. I'm still learning that the hard way but I believe that society believes that you must go to college right after High School or when you do go to college, study in something profitable. I LOVE to make music in general, my line of work is more behind the scenes if anything. My love for Music Production came from my love for Hip-Hop music that I would listen to every day. I got curious at some point and I decided to investigate Music Production. After hours of searching, I'd found "FL Studio" and my journey started there. For the rest of my life I could sit down and learn more about Music Production, different techniques at that. Besides from that, I would like to work at Google because of their versatility with creation of software and hardware. Google has the potential to run everything on the planet. So, I figure I could implement something that could bring my ability to problem solve and to work Audio editing software to combine with Google. Which makes Google the best candidate for me because they are flexible with what they do. Currently, I'm working on a degree for Mobile Computing which involves with mobile devices and such. With those tools, I would be able to program and code for mobile devices as well as come up with new ideas. I would love to create a new way for Music Producers such as I to sell/share beats via mobile devices with the greatest of ease using the support of Google. Google could also help with legal paperwork/E-documents so it does all the work for the seller and the consumer. To be honest, I lost my love with computer programming with its repetitive tendencies. But once I'd realized that, I was too deep and I had to finish my degree in which I'm doing now.</p><br>
               <p> That’s why I'm trying to finish college so I can pursue my dreams to become an A-list Music Producer while honing my programming skills to use my connections in the future to create something revolutionary and ground-breaking. And I hope one day that Google could be that major connection to make my dreams a reality.</p>
